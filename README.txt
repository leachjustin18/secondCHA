This project uses jQuery UI to allow users to drag an answer to which statment they believe it belongs to. Once they drop it, it will disable that button and not allow anymore answers to be dropped on it.  Afte dropping all answers it will show green check if right or red x if incorrect. Then the questions will disapper and a gray box will appear.  This will give instructions to hover over the principles.  When hovering it will show the principle name and related information
